## 1. Description

Remote keyless entry (RKE) is a system designed to remotely control the access to a building or vehicle etc. RKE transmission requires two components: Transmitter(RKE key fob) to send radio frequency signal and a Receiver(Body Control ECU) to receive the signal. RKE system allows a user to lock, open the trunk and unlock the car using a transmitter on the key-fob, which transmits data to a receiver in the vehicle. Here the signal is sent as encrypted data from the key-fob to the particular car.

## 2. Features
* Click the user button once to lock the car
* Click the user button twice to unlock the car.
* Click the user button thrice to alarm activation/deactivation.
* Click the user button four times to activate the approach light.

## 3. High Level Requirements
